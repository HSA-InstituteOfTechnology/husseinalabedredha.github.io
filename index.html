    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p style="text-indent: 35px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I am an Economics & Mathematics student specializing in applied econometrics,
        financial modeling, and quantitative analysis. My work bridges academic research with
        real-world applications in credit risk, portfolio analytics, and corporate finance.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 35px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I focus on econometric modeling, causal inference, land-use and housing supply constraints,
        and market-driven scenario analysis. My academic interests include instrumental variable
        strategies, policy-driven investment responses, and the development of synthetic constraint
        indices for urban markets.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 35px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Beyond research, I have hands-on experience in portfolio reconciliation,
        dealership credit analysis, valuation modeling, and building a private investment fund.
        My goal is to continue producing rigorous research while advancing analytically-driven
        work in finance.
